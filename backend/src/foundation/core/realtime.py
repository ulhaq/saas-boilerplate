"""Realtime events: tell a signed-in user's open app tabs that something changed.

Publishers - the API or the worker - call `publish_to_user` inside their
transaction; the event goes out only after it commits, so a rolled-back write
never announces itself. The app's event stream (`GET /v1/events`) subscribes
to the user's channel and forwards their events as Server-Sent Events.

Delivery is best effort: an event published while nobody listens, or while the
broker is unreachable, is gone. So events are hints ("your notifications
changed"), not data - the database stays the source of truth, and a client
re-fetches what it shows whenever its stream (re)connects or it receives
`RESYNC` (it may have missed events).

The broker is chosen by `REDIS_URL`:

- `RedisBroker`: publishes through Redis pub/sub, so an event from the worker
  or another API replica reaches every API process. Each process keeps one
  Redis subscription and fans events out to its local streams.
- `LocalBroker` (no `REDIS_URL` - local dev and tests): in-process only, so
  events the worker publishes don't reach the API.
